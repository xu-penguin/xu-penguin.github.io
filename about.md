Hello world. My name is Xu Peng (徐鹏), and I am a computer science PhD student at Nanjing University. My main research interest is applying formal methods of analysis to modern machine learning systems. I am also interested in effective altruism and AI safety.

This is my blog, where I will write my thoughts about the world. Not all posts will be about my research. My aims in writing this blog are threefold: to provide useful information to others, to practice my written English, and to serve as a personal log. (According to [one of my favorite economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson), there is another selfish motive: signalling.)

I intend to publish a new blog post at least once every month, hopefully more frequently, but I cannot promise anything.
